# DRIVE-BY ATTACKS

Among various types of cyber attacks, car theft attacks are very common. In these types of network security attacks, hackers insert malicious scripts on multiple websites and finally gain access to all confidential files of users who visit these websites. Through these malicious scripts, the entire system is destroyed and hackers have access to all information.

# RANSOMWARE

Among the types of cyber attacks, ransomware is the most risky one, because very critical information may be threatened. In a ransomware attack, if the victim does not pay the ransom within the deadline set by the cybercriminals, they will be forced to delete all necessary information from their systems. It is also one of the main types of cyber attacks in the health and defense and other sectors. However, there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will protect your files.

# EAVESDROPPING ATTACKS

Eavesdropping attacks are an attack on network security, which cybercriminals carry out from time to time to gain unauthorized access to the files they need. Mobile phones, computers, and laptops are first used by hackers and then used by attackers to create information according to their own wishes. It is important to know the answers to the following questions: How many types of cyber attacks do you need to know?

# MALWARE ATTACKS

In malware attacks, attackers create code called malware to invade digital devices, including laptops, computers, and mobile phones, to gain unauthorized access.

# TROJAN HORSES

A Trojan horse program is a malicious software program whose purpose is to invade digital devices by showing useful software to the victim.

# DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DOS) AND DISTRIBUTED DENIAL-OF-SERVICE (DDOS) ATTACKS

DDoS attacks are one of the common types of network attacks, the purpose of which is to overwhelm the system and make it unable to respond to clients, thus eventually losing a large number of clients immediately.

# URL INTERPRETATION

In these types of network attacks, hackers change and forge specific URLs, through which they can gain unauthorized access to the victim's professional and personal data.

# DNS TUNNELING

It is one of the most dangerous types of cyber attacks. Hackers first invade the digital system, then collect data, and then forge the victim's information. This may take a long time and last a long time. It may also end up permanently damaging the victim's digital system due to the inserted robot and virus.

# SESSION HIJACKING

It is one of the most dangerous types of attacks in network security. These types of active attacks occur when the attacker performs security attacks on the victim's session over and over again from the protected network. This is a dangerous method that allows the attacker to steal all the victim's information and data at the end of the process.

# BRUTE FORCE

It is a method of randomly trying different keys or passwords to unlock the victim's system. It is one of the main types of cyber attacks, which are carried out by many people every day.

It is also one of the common types of attacks on banks and financial institutions on network security.

# AI-POWERED ATTACKS

Machine learning focuses on teaching computers to multitask on their own, rather than relying on humans to perform them manually. Sometimes artificial intelligence is used to crack digital systems in order to obtain unauthorized information. It can also be used to steal confidential financial data. It affects national security and even emotionally harms people.

# BIRTHDAY ATTACKS
